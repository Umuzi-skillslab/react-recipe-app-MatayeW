Reusable UI components such as `Button`, `Card`, `Loading`, `Modal`, and `AudioPlayer` support multiple pages and features.

## Data Flow

Recipe data is stored in `recipesData.js` and loaded into `App.jsx`. `App` provides recipe data to pages and components through props. `RecipesPage` transforms the data by filtering and sorting it before passing the visible recipes to `RecipeList`.

User actions such as favouriting recipes and adding meals update state in `App.jsx`. Callback functions are passed to child components so changes can flow back to the parent. Components then receive the updated state and re-render.

## Props Flow

`App` passes recipes, favourites, loading state, and event handlers to page components. `RecipesPage` passes filtered recipes and favourite information to `RecipeList`, which passes individual recipe data to `RecipeCard`.

The meal-planning state flows from `App` to `MealPlannerPage`, then to `MealPlanner` and individual `DayCard` components. Child components use callback props to communicate changes back to `App`.

## State Strategy

React `useState` manages interactive UI state, including favourites, the weekly meal plan, search terms, filters, sorting, mobile navigation, and meal selections.

Shared state is lifted to `App.jsx` when multiple components need access to the same data. Local state remains inside components when it only affects that component.

`useEffect` handles initial recipe loading and synchronises favourites and the meal plan with browser `localStorage`, allowing user data to persist between sessions.

## Routing Strategy

React Router provides separate routes for the Home page, recipe browsing, individual recipe details, the meal planner, and favourites. Dynamic route parameters are used for individual recipes, while a wildcard route provides a custom 404 page.
